msgid "Ren'Py includes a gesture recognizer that is enabled when a touchscreen is used. This makes it possible for gestures to functions that would otherwise require a keyboard and mouse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/gesture.rst:11
msgid "The gesture recognizer first classifies swipes into 8 compass directions, \"n\", \"ne\", \"e\", \"se\", \"s\", \"sw\", \"w\", \"nw\". North is considered to be towards the top of the screen. It then concatenates the swipes into a string using the \"_\" as a delimiter. For example, if the player swipes down and to the right, the string \"s_e\" will be produced."

#: ../../source/gesture.rst:17
msgid "Assuming :var:`config.dispatch_gesture` is None, what happens next is that gesture is mapped to an event using :var:`config.gestures`. If it is found, it is queued using :func:`renpy.queue_event`. Otherwise, the gesture is ignored."
