msgid "To allow Ren'Py to be scripted in Python, each Ren'Py statement has a Python equivalent. This usually consists of a Python function, but may also consist of a pattern of Python calls that perform an action equivalent to the statement."

msgid "The Ren'Py say statement is equivalent to calling the character object as a function. The following displays the same line twice::"

#: ../../source/statement_equivalents.rst:26
msgid "Displaying narration can be done the same way, by using the ``narrator`` character. When calling a character, it's possible to supply the keyword argument ``interact``. When ``interact`` is False, Ren'Py will display the character dialogue box, and will then return before performing an interaction."

#: ../../source/statement_equivalents.rst:32
msgid "This equivalence of characters and function objects works in the other direction as well. It is possible to declare a Python function, and then use that function in the place of a character object. For example, the following function uses a variable to choose between two characters. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/statement_equivalents.rst:59
msgid "A function used in this way should either ignore unknown keyword arguments, or pass them to a character function. Doing this will allow the game to continue working if Ren'Py adds additional keyword arguments to character calls."
