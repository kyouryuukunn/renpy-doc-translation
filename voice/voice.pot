#: ../../source/voice.rst:68
msgid "This is done by creating voice files that match the identifier for each line of dialogue. To determine the identifiers to use, first export the dialogue to a spreadsheet by choosing from the launcher \"Extract Dialogue\", \"Tab-delimited Spreadsheet (dialogue.tab)\", and \"Continue\". This will produce a file, dialogue.tab, that can be loaded in a spreadsheet program."

msgid "To make Ren'Py automatically play voices, set :var:`config.auto_voice` to a string containing ``{id}``. When dialogue occurs, ``{id}`` is replaced with the dialogue identifier, forming a filename. If the filename exists, it is played."
