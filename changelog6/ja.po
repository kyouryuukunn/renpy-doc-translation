"When a frame takes too long to render (say, because an unpredicted image has "

"Ren'Py itself triggers garbage collection immediately after a frame is "

"By default, Ren'Py will remove transient screens (like say and choice) and "
"displayables without triggering on \"hide\" event handlers. The process of "
"checking  for such handlers was relatively expensive, while the use of those "
"handlers is rare. This change can be reverted by setting :var:`config."
"zap_transients` to False."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog6.rst:276
msgid ""
"Ren'Py will now cache compiled Python expressions the first time it "
"encounters them, rather than compiling an expression each time it is "
"encountered. This speeds up the overused ConditionSwitch displayable, along "
"with other parts of Ren'Py. Because of this change, a game will open slowly "
"the first time it's run under Ren'Py 6.99.14, as all of the expressions need "
"to be compiled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog6.rst:283
msgid ""
"This release both increases the speed of maintaining the information "
"required by rollback, and does so less often. This may be visible to players "

"There have also been many other performance improvements that will only be "
