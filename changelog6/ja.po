"When a frame takes too long to render (say, because an unpredicted image has "

"handlers is rare. This change can be reverted by setting :var:`config."
"zap_transients` to False."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog6.rst:273

"Ren'Py will now cache compiled Python expressions the first time it "
"encounters them, rather than compiling an expression each time it is "
"encountered. This speeds up the overused ConditionSwitch displayable, along "
"with other parts of Ren'Py. Because of this change, a game will open slowly "
"the first time it's run under Ren'Py 6.99.14, as all of the expressions need "
"to be compiled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This release both increases the speed of maintaining the information "
