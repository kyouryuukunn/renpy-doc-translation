msgid "The things that a user sees when looking at a Ren'Py game can be divided into images and user interface. Images are displayed to the user using the scene, show, and hide statements, and are generally part of the story being told. Everything else the user sees is part of the user interface, which is customized using screens."

Some of the information displayed in this manner is vital to gameplay. The `say` screen, for example, is used to display dialogue to the user, including the character's name and what she is saying."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screens.rst:37
msgid "The other thing a screen can do is to allow the user to interact with the game. Buttons and bars allow the user to invoke actions and adjust values. Ren'Py includes a pool of pre-defined actions, allowing the user to advance the game, control preferences, load and save games, and invoke many other actions. A game-maker can also write new actions in Python."
