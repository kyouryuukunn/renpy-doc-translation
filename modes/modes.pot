msgid "In Ren'Py, a mode is a concise way of describing the type of an interaction. When a mode is reported to Ren'Py, user-defined callbacks can be run. These calbacks can be used to react to a change in mode, perhaps by reconfiguring the user interface. For example, one can cause a transition to occur when switching from ADV-mode to NVL-mode, or when going to a menu, etc."
