msgid "Ren'Py has support for saving game state, loading game state, and rolling back to a previous game state. Although implemented in a slightly different fashion, rollback can be thought of as saving the game at the start of each statement that interacts with the user, and loading saves when the user rolls back."

msgid "`a` and `b` are aliased. Saving and loading may break this aliasing, causing `a` and `b` to refer to different objects.

msgid "Supporting Rollback and Roll Forward"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:220
msgid "Most Ren'Py statements automatically support rollback and roll forward. If you call :func:`ui.interact` directly, you'll need to add support for rollback and roll-forward yourself. This can be done using the following structure::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blocking Rollback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:247
msgid "Blocking rollback is a user-unfriendly thing to do. If a user mistakenly clicks on an unintended choice, he or she will be unable to correct their mistake. Since rollback is equivalent to saving and loading, your users will be forced to save more often, breaking game engagement."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is possible to disable rollback in part or in full. If rollback is not wanted at all, it can simply be turned off through the :var:`config.rollback_enabled` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:256
msgid "More common is a partial block of rollback. This can be achieved by the :func:`renpy.block_rollback` function. When called, it will instruct Ren'Py not to roll back before that point. For example::"

msgid "Fixing Rollback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:284
msgid "Fixing rollback provides for an intermediate choice between unconstrained rollback and blocking rollback entirely. Rollback is allowed, but the user is not allowed to make changes to their decisions. Fixing rollback is done with the :func:`renpy.fix_rollback` function, as shown in the following example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:306
msgid "Now, after the fix_rollback function is called, it will still be possible for the user to roll back to the menu. However, it will not be possible to make a different choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:310
msgid "There are some caveats to consider when designing a game for fix_rollback. Ren'Py will automatically take care of locking any data that is given to :func:`checkpoint`. However, due to the generic nature of Ren'Py, it is possible to write Python that bypasses this and changes things in ways that may have unpredictable results. It is up to the game designer to block rollback at problematic locations or write additional Python to deal with it."

msgid "Styling Fixed Rollback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:324
msgid "Because fix_rollback changes the functionality of menus and imagemaps, it is advisable to reflect this in the appearance. To do this, it is important to understand how the widget states of the menu buttons are changed. There are two modes that can be selected through the :var:`config.fix_rollback_without_choice` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:330
msgid "The default option will set the chosen option to \"selected\", thereby activating the style properties with the \"selected\\_\" prefix. All other buttons will be made insensitive and show using the properties with the \"insensitive\\_\" prefix. Effectively this leaves the menu with a single selectable choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:336
msgid "When the :var:`config.fix_rollback_without_choice` option is set to False, all buttons are made insensitive. This means that the chosen option will use the \"selected_insensitive\\_\" prefix for the style properties while the other buttons use properties with the \"insensitive\\_\" prefix."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:343
msgid "Fixed Rollback and Custom Screens"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:345
msgid "When writing custom Python routines that must play nice with the fix_rollback system there are a few simple things to know. First of all the :func:`renpy.in_fixed_rollback` function can be used to determine whether the game is currently in fixed rollback state. Second, when in fixed rollback state, :func:`ui.interact` will always return the supplied roll_forward data regardless of what action was performed. This effectively means that when the :func:`ui.interact`/:func:`renpy.checkpoint` functions are used, most of the work is done."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/save_load_rollback.rst:354
msgid "To simplify the creation of custom screens, two actions are provided to help with the most common uses. The :func:`ui.ChoiceReturn` action returns the value when the button it is attached to is clicked. The :func:`ui.ChoiceJump` action can be used to jump to a script label. However, this action only works properly when the screen is called trough a ``call screen`` statement."
