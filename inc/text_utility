.. function:: renpy.filter_text_tags(s, allow=None, deny=None)
    
    Returns a copy of `s` with the text tags filtered. Exactly one of the `allow` and `deny` keyword
    arguments must be given.
    
    `allow`
        A set of tags that are allowed. If a tag is not in this list, it is removed.
    
    `deny`
        A set of tags that are denied. If a tag is not in this list, it is kept in the string.

.. function:: renpy.transform_text(s, function)
    
    Transforms `s`, while leaving text tags and interpolation the same.
    
    `function`
        A function that is called with strings corresponding to runs of
        text, and should return a second string that replaces that run
        of text.

        $ upper = renpy.transform_text("{b}Not Upper{/b}")
