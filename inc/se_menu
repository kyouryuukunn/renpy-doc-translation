.. function:: renpy.display_menu(items, interact=True, screen="choice")
    
    This displays a menu to the user. `items` should be a list of 2-item tuples.
    In each tuple, the first item is a textual label, and the second item is
    the value to be returned if that item is selected. If the value is None,
    the first item is used as a menu caption.
    
    This function takes many arguments, of which only a few are documented.
    Except for `items`, all arguments should be given as keyword arguments.
    
    `interact`
        If false, the menu is displayed, but no interaction is performed.
    
    `screen`
        The name of the screen used to display the menu.
    
    Note that most Ren'Py games do not use menu captions, but use narration
    instead. To display a menu using narration, write::
    
        $ narrator("Which direction would you like to go?", interact=False)
        $ result = renpy.display_menu([ ("East", "east"), ("West", "west") ])
