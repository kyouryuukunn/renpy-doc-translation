    This can be used to override the line breaking class of a character. For
    example, the linebreaking class of a character can be set to ID to
    treat it as an ideograph, which allows breaks before and after that
    character.
    
    `chars`
        A string containing each of the characters to tailor.
    
    `cls`

        1 of `UAX #14: Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-30.html>`_.
