.. function:: renpy.say(who, what, *args, **kwargs)
    
    The equivalent of the say statement.
    
    `who`
        Either the character that will say something, None for the narrator,
        or a string giving the character name. In the latter case, the
        :func:`say` is used to create the speaking character.
    
    `what`
        A string giving the line to say. Percent-substitutions are performed
        in this string.
    
    `interact`
        If true, Ren'Py waits for player input when displaying the dialogue. If
        false, Ren'Py shows the dialogue, but does not perform an interaction.
        (This is passed in as a keyword argument.)
    
    This function is rarely necessary, as the following three lines are
    equivalent. ::
    
        e "Hello, world."
        $ renpy.say(e, "Hello, world.")
        $ e("Hello, world.")
