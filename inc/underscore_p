.. function:: _p(s)
    
    Reformats a string and flags it as translatable. The string will be
    translated when displayed by the text displayable. This is intended
    to define multi-line for use in strings, of the form::
    
        define config.about = _p("""
            These two lines will be combined together
            to form a long line.
    
            This line will be separate.
            """)
    
    The reformatting is done by breaking the text up into lines,
    removing whitespace from the start and end of each line. Blank lines
    are removed at the end. When there is a blank line, a blank line is
    inserted to separate paragraphs. The {p} tag breaks a line, but
    doesn't add a blank one.
    
    This can be used in a string translation, using the construct::
    
        old "These two lines will be combined together to form a long line.\n\nThis line will be separate."
        new _p("""
            These two lines will be combined together
            to form a long line. Bork bork bork.
    
            This line will be separate. Bork bork bork.
            """)
