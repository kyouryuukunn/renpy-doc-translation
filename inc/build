.. function:: build.archive(name, file_list=u'all')
    
    Declares the existence of an archive. If one or more files are
    classified with `name`, `name`.rpa is build as an archive. The
    archive is included in the named file lists.

.. function:: build.classify(pattern, file_list)
    
    Classifies files that match `pattern` into `file_list`.

.. function:: build.clear()
    
    Clears the list of patterns used to classify files.

.. function:: build.documentation(pattern)
    
    Declares a pattern that matches documentation. In a mac app build,
    files matching the documentation pattern are stored twice - once
    inside the app package, and again outside of it.

.. function:: build.executable(pattern)
    
    Adds a pattern marking files as executable on platforms that support it.
    (Linux and Macintosh)
