.. function:: gui.SetPreference(name, value, rebuild=True)
    
    This Action sets the gui preference with `name` to `value`.
    
    `rebuild`
        If true, the default, :func:`gui.rebuild` is called to make
        the changes take effect. This should generally be true, except
        in the case of multiple gui.SetPreference actions, in which case
        it should be False in all but the last one.
    
    This is a very slow action, and probably not suitable for use
    when a button is hovered.

.. function:: gui.TogglePreference(name, a, b, rebuild=True)
    
    This Action toggles the gui preference with `name` between
    value `a` and value `b`. It is selected if the value is equal
    to `a`.
    
    `rebuild`
        If true, the default, :func:`gui.rebuild` is called to make
        the changes take effect. This should generally be true, except
        in the case of multiple gui.SetPreference actions, in which case
        it should be False in all but the last one.
    
    This is a very slow action, and probably not suitable for use
    when a button is hovered.

.. function:: gui.preference(name, default=<renpy.python.RevertableObject object at 0x7fab05c629d0>)
    
    This function returns the value of the gui preference with
    `name`.
    
    `default`
        If given, this value becomes the default value of the gui
        preference. The default value should be given the first time
        the preference is used.
