msgstr ""

#: ../../source/android.rst:248
msgid "Ren'Py allows you to select between two release modes, Debug and Release. The debug mode is useful for testing, as it allows you to easily use Android studio to view the logs or files on the device. Release produces a version of the app suitable to upload to the various stores."
