msgid "Like all games and other software that you run on your computer, you should only run a Ren'Py game if you trust the creator and everyone involved in getting the game to you. Malicious software, including games written in Ren'Py, can perform arbitrarily harmful actions on your computer, and can even send information elsewhere."

msgid "Ren'Py save files, including the ``persistent`` file, are created using the Python pickle format. This file format is powerful enough that it should be treated like software - if a malicious person can get you to load a file they created, they can run arbitrary code on your computer."

msgid "Save and persistent files are not designed to be shared between players, and so those files may contain information about you and your computer. We recommend that you do not share save and persistent files with other users."
