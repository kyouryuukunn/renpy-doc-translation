msgid "There are two kinds of special screen names in Ren'Py. The first are screens that will be automatically displayed when Ren'Py script language commands (or their programmatic equivalents) are run. The other type are menu screens. These have conventional names for conventional functionality, but screens can be omitted or changed as is deemed necessary."

#: ../../source/screen_special.rst:17
msgid "On this page, we'll give example screens. It's important to realize that, while some screens must have minimal functionality, the screen system makes it possible to add additional functionality to screens. For example, while the standard say screen only displays text, the screen system makes it easy to add features like skipping, auto-forward mode, or muting."
