msgid "`Live2D Cubism <https://www.live2d.com/en/>`_ is a system that allows you to animate 2D images, such as the character sprites in a visual novel. These images are drawn in a series of layers - for example, a layer for pupils and irises, a layer for the whites of the eyes, a layer for the eyebrows, and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:13
msgid "The Live2D software lets you associate meshes with each of these layers, and then specify how the meshes are deformed (the shape of each mesh is changed) as the parameters are adjusted. The Live2D software lets you create motion files that determine how these parameters are adjusted over time, and expression files that determine expressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:19
msgid "Ren'Py's Live2D integration involves taking the files that Live2D produces, and using them to define animations that can be displayed in Ren'Py. Ren'Py processes the motions and expressions to determine the values of the parameters. This is passed to the Cubism SDK for Native, which gives Ren'Py back a list of meshes to show. Ren'Py then renders these meshes, and the result is a Live2D character on the screen."

msgid "Before you can use Live2D, you'll need to download and install the Cubism SDK for Native, found on the `Live2D website <https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/download-native/>`_. Please note that you may need to purchase a license to use Live2D if your business makes more than a certain amount of money a year."

msgid "Once you've downloaded Live2D, you can install it from the Ren'Py launcher. To install, go to \"preferences\", then click \"Install libraries\". Place the CubismSdkForNative-4-r.1.zip file in the Ren'Py SDK directory, which can be accessed using the button in the bottom right of the install libraries screen. Then click \"Install Live2D Cubism SDK for Native\". After a short amount of time, Live2D will be installed."

msgid "Using Animations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:143
msgid "The usual way to display a Live2D image is to display it using the show statement. In addition to any attributes added as part of the image statement, the names of expressions and motions can be used."

msgid "Some examples are::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:153
msgid "These use the default names found in the Cubism SDK sample names. The names of the motions and expressions are taken from the Live2D files, and if they begin with the name of the model3.json file (without directories or extensions), followed by an underscore, then that prefix is removed. (For example, \"Hiyori_m01\" becomes just m01.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:159
msgid "At most one exclusive expression can be used, and any number of nonexclusive expressions and motions can be given. When more than one motion is given, the motions are played in order, and the final motion is looped if loop is True. This makes it possible for a motion to be played, followed by an idle animation. Each motion can only appear once, unless multiple aliases for that motion are created."

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:176
msgid "Many Live2D models are defined at high resolutions, at least in the internal coordinate system that the models use. To compensate for this, Ren'Py includes two ways to scale down the Live2D model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:180
msgid "The first is the `zoom` argument. This can directly set the zoom factor of the model. If zoom is used, then the other scaling parameters are ignored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:183
msgid "Otherwise, the `top`, `base`, and `height` arguments are used. The first two specify two lines, relative to the top and bottom of the image. (As elsewhere in Ren'Py, 0.0 is the top and 1.0 is the bottom.) When these arguments are used, two things happen:"

msgid "Ren'Py's support for Live2D includes motion fading. Normally, when Ren'Py changes from one animation to another, the transition is abrupt - one animation is stopped, and the other starts. If a transition occurs, both animations are played at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live2d.rst:208
msgid "Live2D supports a different model, in which the old animation can be smoothly faded into the new one, but interpolating the parameters. Think of this like a character moving their arms into position, rather than dissolving from one position to another."
