#: ../../source/gui.rst:35
msgid "There are a few simple pieces of GUI customization that make sense for all but the simplest visual novels. What these customizations have in common is that they do not require editing gui.rpy. These customizations change the GUI somewhat, but do not drastically change the look of the GUI."
