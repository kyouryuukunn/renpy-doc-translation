msgid "In addition to the normal channel, there is one special channel, ``audio``. The audio channel supports playing back multiple audio files at one time, but does not support queueing sound or stopping playback."

#: ../../source/audio.rst:34
msgid "Sounds can also be set to play when buttons, menu choices, or imagemaps enter their hovered or activated states. See :ref:`Button Style Properties <button-style-properties>`. Two configuration variables, :var:`config.main_menu_music` and :var:`config.game_menu_music` allow for the given music files to be played as the main and game menu music, respectively."

msgid "In-game, the usual way to play music and sound in Ren'Py is using the three music/sound statements."

msgid "Play Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:48
msgid "The ``play`` statement is used to play sound and music. If a file is currently playing on a normal channel, it is interrupted and replaced with the new file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:52
msgid "The name of a channel is expected following the keyword ``play``. (Usually, this is either \"sound\", \"music\", \"voice\", or \"audio\"). This is followed by audiofile(s), where audiofile(s) can be one file or list of files. When the list is given, the item of it is played in order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:58
msgid "The ``fadein`` and ``fadeout`` clauses are optional. Fadeout gives the fadeout time for currently playing music, in seconds, while fadein gives the time it takes to fade in the new music. If fadeout is not given, :var:`config.fade_music` is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:63
msgid "The ``loop`` and ``noloop`` clauses are also optional. The loop clause causes the music to loop, while noloop causes it to play only once. If neither of them are given, the default of the channel is used. ::"

msgid "The queue statement begins with keyword ``queue``, followed by the the name of a channel to play sound on. It optionally takes the ``loop`` and ``noloop`` clauses. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:104
msgid "The advantage of using these statements is that your program will be checked for missing sound and music files when lint is run. The functions below exist to allow access to allow music and sound to be controlled from Python, and to expose advanced (rarely used) features."

msgid "Partial Playback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:115
msgid "Ren'Py supports partial of audio files. This is done by putting a playback specification, enclosed in angle brackets, at the start of the file. The partial playback specification should consist of alternating property name and value pairs, with every thing separated by spaces."

msgid "Audio Namespace"

msgid "The ``play`` and ``queue`` statements evaluate their arguments in the audio namespace. This means it is possible to use the define statement to provide an alias for an audio file."
