msgid "Ren'Py supports an arbitrary number of audio channels. There are three normal channels defined by default:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:18
msgid "``music`` - A channel for music playback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:19
msgid "``sound`` - A channel for sound effects."

msgid "``voice`` - A channel for voice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:22
msgid "Normal channels support playing and queueing audio, but only play back one audio file at a time. New normal channels can be registered with :func:`renpy.music.register_channel`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:26
msgid "The Music Volume, Sound Volume, and Voice Volume settings of the in-game preferences menu are used to set individual volumes for these channels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:30
msgid "In addition to the normal channel, there is one special channel, ``audio``. The audio channel supports playing back multiple audio files at one time, but does not support queueing sound or stopping playback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:34
msgid "Sounds can also be set to play when buttons, menu choices, or imagemaps enter their hovered or activated states. See :ref:`Button Style Properties <button-style-properties>`. Two configuration variables, :var:`config.main_menu_music` and :var:`config.game_menu_music` allow for the given music files to be played as the main and game menu music, respectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:41
msgid "In-game, the usual way to play music and sound in Ren'Py is using the three music/sound statements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:46
msgid "Play Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:48
msgid "The ``play`` statement is used to play sound and music. If a file is currently playing on a normal channel, it is interrupted and replaced with the new file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:52
msgid "The name of a channel is expected following the keyword ``play``. (Usually, this is either \"sound\", \"music\", \"voice\", or \"audio\"). This is followed by audiofile(s), where audiofile(s) can be one file or list of files. When the list is given, the item of it is played in order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:58
msgid "The ``fadein`` and ``fadeout`` clauses are optional. Fadeout gives the fadeout time for currently playing music, in seconds, while fadein gives the time it takes to fade in the new music. If fadeout is not given, :var:`config.fade_music` is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:63
msgid "The ``loop`` and ``noloop`` clauses are also optional. The loop clause causes the music to loop, while noloop causes it to play only once. If neither of them are given, the default of the channel is used. ::"

msgid "On the audio channel, multiple play statements play multiple sounds at the same time::"

msgid "Stop Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:84
msgid "The ``stop`` statement begins with the keyword ``stop``, followed by the the name of a channel to stop sound on. It may optionally have a ``fadeout`` clause. ::"

#: ../../source/audio.rst:93
msgid "Queue Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:95
msgid "The ``queue`` statement is used to queue up audio files. They will be played when the channel finishes playing the currently playing file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:98
msgid "The queue statement begins with keyword ``queue``, followed by the the name of a channel to play sound on. It optionally takes the ``loop`` and ``noloop`` clauses. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:104
msgid "The advantage of using these statements is that your program will be checked for missing sound and music files when lint is run. The functions below exist to allow access to allow music and sound to be controlled from Python, and to expose advanced (rarely used) features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:113
msgid "Partial Playback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:115
msgid "Ren'Py supports partial of audio files. This is done by putting a playback specification, enclosed in angle brackets, at the start of the file. The partial playback specification should consist of alternating property name and value pairs, with every thing separated by spaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:120
msgid "The values are always interpreted as seconds from the start of the file. The three properties are:"

msgid "Playing Silence"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:152
msgid "A specified duration of silence can played using a filename like \"<silence 3.0>\", where 3.0 is the number of seconds of silence that is desired. This can be used to delay the start of a sound file. For example::"

msgid "Will play silence for half a second, and then an explosion sound."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:164
msgid "Audio Namespace"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:166
msgid "The ``play`` and ``queue`` statements evaluate their arguments in the audio namespace. This means it is possible to use the define statement to provide an alias for an audio file."

msgid "Ren'Py will also automatically place sound files in the audio name face, if found in the ``game/audio`` directory. Files in this directory with a supported extension (currently, .wav, .mp2, .mp3, .ogg, and .opus) have the extension stripped, the rest of the filename forced to lower case, and are placed into the audio namespace."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/audio.rst:184
msgid "Note that just because a file is placed into the audio namespace, that doesn't mean it can be used. So while you could play a file named \"opening_song.ogg\" by writing::"

#: ../../source/audio.rst:190
msgid "Some filenames can't be accessed this way, as their names are not expressable as Python variables. For example, \"my song.mp3\", \"8track.opus\", and \"this-is-a-song.ogg\" won't work."
