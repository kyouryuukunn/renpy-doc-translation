msgid "Strings may have one or more square-bracket substitutions in them, such as \"eileen [mood]\" or \"eileen_[outfit]_[mood].png\". When such a string is given, a dynamic image is created.

msgid "The most commonly used displayable is Image, which loads a file from disk and displays it. Since Image is so commonly used, when a string giving a filename is used in a context that expects a displayable, an Image is automatically created. The only time it's necessary to use Image directly is when you want to create an image with style properties."

msgid "Loading an Image from from a file on disk and decoding it so it can be drawn to the screen takes a long amount of time. While measured in the tenths or hundreds of seconds, the duration of the loading process is long enough that it can prevent an acceptable framerate, and become annoying to the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:83
msgid "Since an Image is of a fixed size, and doesn't change in response to input, game state, or the size of the area available to it, an Image can be loaded before it is needed, and placed into an area of memory known as the image cache. Once an Image is decoded and in the cache, it can be quickly drawn to the screen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:89
msgid "Ren'Py attempts to predict the images that will be used in the future, and loads them into the image cache before they are used. When space in the cache is needed for other images, Ren'Py will remove images that are no longer being used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:94
msgid "By default, Ren'Py will predictively cache up to 8 screens worth of image data. (If your screen is 800x600, then a screen's worth of data is one 800x600 image, two 400x600 images, and so on.) This can be changed with the :var:config.image_cache_size configuration variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:100
msgid "Although the precise amount is dependent on implementation details and there is significant overhead, as a rule of thumb, each pixel in the image cache consumes 4 bytes of main memory and 4 bytes of video memory."

msgid "Image-Like Displayables"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:108
msgid "We call these displayables image-like because they take up a rectangular area of the screen, and do not react to input.  These differ from normal images by varying their size to fill an area (Frame, LiveTile, and Solid), or by allowing the user to specify their size (LiveComposite, LiveCrop, Null). They are not image manipulators."

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:131
msgid "Note that these dynamic displayables always display their current state. Because of this, a dynamic displayable will not participate in a transition. (Or more precisely, it will display the same thing in both the old and new states of the transition.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:136
msgid "By design, dynamic displayables are intended to be used for things that change rarely and when an image define this way is off screen (Such as a character customization system), and not for things that change frequently, such as character emotions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:206
msgid "An image manipulator can be used any place a displayable can, but not vice-versa. An :func:`Image` is a kind of image manipulator, so an Image can be used whenever an image manipulator is required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/displayables.rst:210
msgid "With the few exceptions listed below, the use of image manipulators is historic. A number of image manipulators that had been documented in the past should no longer be used, as they suffer from inherent problems. In many cases, the :func:`Transform` displayable provides similar functionality in a more general manner, while fixing the problems."
