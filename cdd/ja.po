msgid "The most complex, but most powerful, way of customizing Ren'Py's behavior is to use a creator-defined displayable. A creator-defined displayable is allowed to take arbitrary pygame events. It can also render other displayables, and place them at arbitrary locations on the screen. This makes it suitable for creating 2D mini-games that cannot be expressed with the tools Ren'Py gives you. (But see also the section :ref:`sprites <sprites>`, which describes a higher-level way of accomplishing many of the same things.)"
