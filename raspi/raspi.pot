#: ../../source/raspi.rst:10
msgid "It's important to realize that the Raspberry Pi is a very limited system, even compared to iOS and Android smartphones. As a result, not every Ren'Py game will run well – or at all – on a Raspberry Pi. What's more, it's possible to crash Ren'Py by allowing a game to use more RAM than the system has available to it."

msgid "When the Raspberry Pi is configured correctly, Ren'Py should run using the device's hardware OpenGL ES. This means that it has the same limitations as the Android and iOS platforms, with respect to :propref:`focus_mask` not working."
