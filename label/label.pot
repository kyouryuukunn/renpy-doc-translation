msgid "Label Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:10
msgid "Label statements allow the given name to be assigned to a program point. They exist solely to be called or jumped to, either from Ren'Py script, Python functions, or from screens. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:21
msgid "A label statement may have a block associated with it. In that case, control enters the block whenever the label statement is reached, and proceeds with the statement after the label statement whenever the end of the block is reached."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:25
msgid "There are two kinds of labels: *global* and *local* labels. Global labels live in one global scope shared across all project files and thus should have unique names per game. Local labels logically reside inside scope of the global label they are declared in. To declare a local label, prefix its name with `.`. For example: ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:37
msgid "Local labels can be referenced directly inside the same global label they are declared in or by their full name, consisting of global and local name parts: ::"

#: ../../source/label.rst:44
msgid "The label statement may take an optional list of parameters. These parameters are processed as described in PEP 3102, with two exceptions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:47
msgid "The values of default parameters are evaluated at call time."

msgid "Jump Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:55
msgid "The jump statement is used to transfer control to the given label."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:57
msgid "If the ``expression`` keyword is present, the expression following it is evaluated, and the string so computed is used as the label name of the statement to jump to. If the ``expression`` keyword is not present, the label name of the statement to jump to must be explicitly given."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:62
msgid "Unlike call, jump does not push the next statement onto a stack. As a result, there's no way to return to where you've jumped from. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:74
msgid "Call Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:76
msgid "The call statement is used to transfer control to the given label. It also pushes the next statement onto the call stack, allowing the return statement to return control to the statement following the call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:80
msgid "If the ``expression`` keyword is present, the expression following it is evaluated, and the string so computed is used as the name of the label to call. If the ``expression`` keyword is not present, the name of the statement to call must be explicitly given."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:85
msgid "If the optional from clause is present, it has the effect of including a label statement with the given name as the statement immediately following the call statement. An explicit label helps to ensure that saved games with return stacks can return to the proper place when loaded on a changed script. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:107
msgid "The call statement may take arguments, which are processed as described in PEP 3102."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:110
msgid "When using a call expression with an arguments list, the ``pass`` keyword must be inserted between the expression and the arguments list. Otherwise, the arguments list will be parsed as part of the expression, not as part of the call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:118
msgid "Return Statement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:120
msgid "The return statement pops the top statement off of the call stack, and transfers control to it. If the call stack is empty, the return statement restarts Ren'Py, returning control to the main menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:124
msgid "If the optional expression is given to return, it is evaluated, and it's result is stored in the _return variable. This variable is dynamically scoped to each context."

msgid "``main_menu``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.rst:154
msgid "If it exists, this label is called instead of the main menu. If it returns, Ren'Py will start the game at the ``start`` label. For example, the following will immediately start the game without displaying the main menu. ::"

msgid "This function creates a new context, and invokes the given Python callable (function) in that context. When the function returns or raises an exception, control returns to the the original context.
