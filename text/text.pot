msgid "Ren'Py contains several ways of displaying text. The :ref:`say <say-statement>` and :ref:`menu <menu-statement>` are primarily concerned with the display of text to the user. The user interface often contains text, displayed using the :ref:`text <sl-text>`, :ref:`textbutton <sl-textbutton>`, and :ref:`label <sl-label>` screen language statements. These functions, along with others, create :func:`Text` displayables, and show them on the screen."
