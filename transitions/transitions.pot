msgid "Transitions can be used as part of the :ref:`with statement <with-statement>`, as well as in other parts of Ren'Py, to apply effects to changes in the scene. Ren'Py comes with a small number of pre-defined transitions, which can be given directly to the with statement. It also includes transition classes, which can be used to create new transitions."
