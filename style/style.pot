msgid "Styles allow the look of displayables to be customized. This is done by changing the value of style properties for displayables. For example, changing the :propref:`background` property allows the background of a window or button to be customized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/style.rst:15
msgid "Style properties consist of two parts, a prefix that specifies when the property is used, and the property itself. For example, a button's ``hover_background`` property is used when a button is focused, while its ``idle_background`` property is used when the button is unfocused. (Setting the ``background`` property sets the ``idle_background`` and ``hover_background``, among others.)"

Along with ``background``, we use ``color``, ``font``, ``outlines`` and ``size`` as style properties.

msgid "Each displayable has a style built-into it. When the displayable is created, either directly or using the screen system, style properties can be supplied to it, and these styles are used to update the look of the displayable. In the following example::"

msgid "Ren'Py supports style inheritance, with each style having a single parent. If a style property is not defined in a style, the value of the property is inherited from the closest parent, grandparent, or other ancestor."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/style.rst:62
msgid "When no ``style`` property is given, a parent is chosen based on the kind of displayable be that has been supplied. The parent chosen can be influenced by the :ref:`style_prefix <style-prefix>` property of user interface statements in the screen language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/style.rst:67
msgid "When a style is defined without a parent being specified, a default parent is chosen for the style. If the style contains an underscore (_) in its name, the parent is named by removing everything up to and including the first underscore. For example, a style named ``my_button`` will inherit from ``button``. This inheritance can be changed using the style statement or by calling a method on a style object.  When a style that does not exist is used, and the style has an underscore in its name, Ren'Py will create it using the default parent."
