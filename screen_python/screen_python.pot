msgid "Ren'Py supports defining screens in Python, as well as in the Ren'Py screen language. A Python screen is created by supplying a screen function to the :func:`renpy.define_screen` function. It can then be used like it was any other screen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_python.rst:13
msgid "The screen function should have parameters corresponding to the scope variables it expects, and it should ignore extra keyword arguments. (That is, it should have `**kwargs` at the end of its parameter list.) It is then expected to call the UI functions to add displayables to the screen.The screen function is called whenever an interaction starts or restarts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/screen_python.rst:20
msgid "To ensure that this restarting is seamless to the user (and not causing things to reset), it's important that every call to a UI function supply the `id` argument. As a screen is re-created, Ren'Py will update each displayable with the contents of the old displayable with the same id. Ids are generated automatically by the screen language, but when doing things by hand, they must be manually specified."
