msgid "sets the default text speed to 40 characters per second. The default statement only sets the value of the preference if the default has changed since the preference was set. For example, if the player changes the speed to 50, it will remain at 50 over future runs of the game. If, in an upgrade, the default is set to 42, the player's setting will be changed to 42. (The player can then change it again.)"
