msgid "In Ren'Py keysyms are strings representing mouse buttons, joystick buttons, or keyboard keys."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/keymap.rst:20
msgid "Mouse buttons use keysyms of the form 'mouseup_#' or 'mousedown_#', where # is a button number. Ren'Py assumes a five button mouse, where buttons 1, 2, and 3 are the left, middle, and right buttons, while buttons 4 and 5 are generated by scrolling the wheel up and down. For example, \"mousedown_1\" is generally a press of the left mouse button, \"mouseup_1\" is a release of that button, and \"mousedown_4\" is a turn of the scroll wheel to the top."

#: ../../source/keymap.rst:28
msgid "There are two kinds of keyboard keysyms. The first is a string containing a character that is generated when a key is pressed. This is useful for binding alphabetic keys and numbers. Examples of these keysyms include \"a\", \"A\", and \"7\"."

#: ../../source/keymap.rst:32
msgid "Keyboard keysyms can also be the symbolic name for the key. This can be any of the K\\_ constants taken from pygame.constants. This type of keysym looks like \"K\\_BACKSPACE\", \"K\\_RETURN\", and \"K\\_TAB\"; a full list of this kind of keysyms may be found `here <http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html>`_."
