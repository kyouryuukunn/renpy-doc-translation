msgid "The drag and drop displayables make it possible to implement these and other uses of drag and drop. There are two classes involved here. The Drag class represents either something that can be dragged around the screen, something that can have a draggable dropped onto it, or something that can do both. The DragGroup class represents a group of Drags - for a drag and drop to occur, both Drags must be part of the same drag group."

#: ../../source/drag_drop.rst:28
msgid "The drag and drop system can be used either through the :ref:`Screen Language <screens>` or directly as displayables. It makes sense to use the screen language when you don't need to refer to the Drags that you create after they've been created. This might be the case if the draggable represents a window that the user places on the screen. If you need to refer to the drags after they've been created, then it's often better to create Drags directly, and add them to a DragGroup."
