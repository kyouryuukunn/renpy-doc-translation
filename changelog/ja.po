msgid ""
"This release includes updated versions of the Tutorial game and \"The "
"Question\", the example game that's bundled with Ren'Py."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:17
msgid ""
"The Tutorial game has been largely rewritten, and is now structured as a "
"pair lectures, the first covering the creation of a basic visual novel in "
"Ren'Py, and the second covering in-depth topics needed to create more "
"advanced games. The Tutorial has also lost content that is less relevant to "
"modern Ren'Py, focusing in on the features that are the best practice to use "
"in new games."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:23
msgid ""
"The Tutorial now has over 250 examples, that can now be copied out of the "
"tutorial and into your own projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:26
msgid ""
"\"The Question\" has been rewritten with a new script by Lore, one that is "
"more appropriate for educational use than the original. It's also been "
"updated with new background, and to demonstrate best practices when writing "
"Ren'Py scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:31
msgid ""
"Both games have been modernized with high-definition widescreen graphics and "
"use of the new default Ren'Py GUI."

"Right now, the old tutorial is still distributed with Ren'Py, and is used if "

msgstr ""

msgid "Interactive Director"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:41
msgid ""
"Ren'Py now ships with an built in interactive director tool. This tool makes "
"it possible to add the scene, show, hide, with, play, queue, stop, and voice "
"statements to Ren'Py from inside an under-development visual novel, without "
"having to change to a text editor and reload the project. The interactive "
"director can be accessed by pressing the D key (without shift) inside an "
"unreleased game."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:48

"The interactive director had been distributed outside of Ren'Py, with a "
"license that made it free for noncommercial use. It's now part of Ren'Py, "

msgid "New GUI"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:56
msgid ""
"A few changes have been made to the new GUI. Buttons have been brightened "

"For newly-generated games, it is now possible to customize the location and "

msgid ""
"The Raspberry Pi port is similar to the Android and iOS ports, both in its "
"limitations and how it's meant to run games rather than develop them. As "
"with all platforms, creators developing for the Raspberry Pi need to account "
"for the resources available to them and design their games accordingly."

"This release introduces a new screen system, which allows one to use the new "
"screen language to declaratively specify portions of the user interface. The "
"screen language supersedes layouts, overlay functions, imagemaps, and most "
"other means of customizing the out-of-game menus and the in-game screens."

#: ../../source/changelog.rst:3669
msgid ""
"The previous way of customizing the behavior of the game menu, the layout "
"system, had problems, especially when using imagemap layouts. Screens were "
"single-purpose, and it would be difficult to (for example) load a quick-save "
"game from the main menu, without extensive Python code."
