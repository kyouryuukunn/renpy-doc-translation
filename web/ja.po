"Ren'Py supports running games in a web browser. This is done by with a "
"version of Ren'Py that has been compiled to WebAssembly, allowing as much as "
"possible of Ren'Py to run in the browser. This page will explain some of the "
"limitations of running inside a browser, help you design your game to run "
"well, and explain how to build your game for the web."

msgid ""
"Like all games running inside a web browser, Ren'Py games have a number of "
"limitations on them. Some of these are imposed by the sandbox in the "
"browser, while others have been chosen to reduce the amount of data that "
"needs to be downloaded before a game can start."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:18
msgid "Some limitations are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:20
msgid ""
"Video is played back using the browser's built-in video playback. This "
"limits the formats that can be played back to those supported by the web "
"browser, and only :func:`renpy.movie_cutscene` is supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:24
msgid ""
"Audio playback may use the browsers audio format, which is fast, or may use "
"Ren'Py's built in audio playback, which is slower, but supports more "
"formats. See the section below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:28
msgid ""
"The web port doesn't support multi-threading, so functions like :func:`renpy."
"invoke_in_thread` and the Python ``threading`` module are not supported. "
"This can also limit the performance of some games - on desktop and mobile "
"Ren'Py, images can be preloaded in the background, but on the web port this "
"is not possible, and so image loading may cause framerate glitches."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:34
msgid ""
"Networking is not supported. This might be surprising, but the browser "
"sandbox prevents Ren'Py from making arbitrary network requests. This means "
"that sockets and the requests library will return errors when run inside the "
"web browser."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:39
msgid ""
"In addition, there are some limitations that can be caused by where you host "
"your game. Some hosting providers limit the size of a game and the number of "
"files that can be included as part of a project. As an example, `itch.io "
"<https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5#zip-file-requirements>`_ documents "
"these limits. Browsers provide other limits - files that are greater than "
"50MB in size won't be cached, which means big files will be downloaded every "
"time your game is run."

msgid ""
"We try to keep Ren'Py running in recent versions of evergreen browsers like "
"Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, as well as the mobile versions of these "
"browsers on iOS and Android. Ren'Py may work in other browsers, but it "
"depends on the browser's support for WebAssembly and other features required "
"by Ren'Py."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:56

"Ren'Py does require many modern web features, and so won't run if these "
"features are blocked or disabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/web.rst:59
msgid ""
"While we try to keep Ren'Py running, Ren'Py can push the edge of what a "
"browser is capable of, and so it's possible that changes to the browsers "
"will render them incapable of running games. We work with browser vendors to "
"ensure the browsers keep working, but it's possible that a change to the "
"browser will require your game to be updated."
